# CONTRACTSMITH
Write and deploy smart contracts to Mantle using natural language prompts. Integrate with other Mantle ecosystem Dapps easier than ever before.  Built for SOZU Haus Paris Hackathon 2023!

## The problem CONTRACTSMITH solves
Integrating with existing Dapps when writing a smart contract can be challenging and tedious. CONTRACTSMITH addresses this by automating the entire process from inception to deployment. Our chat assistant is well-versed in existing Dapps on Mantle, including KYCat and API3. CONTRACTSMITH knows how to seamlessly integrate with each Dapp, leveraging established solutions and documentation. This leads to enhanced collaboration between contracts and Dapps. This also opens the door to new, never thought of solutions that require custom contract deployents at a user level. Another problem we are solving with out solution is Sibel Attacks (especially when onboarding or offering a free service to new users). Using zKMe's Antibot Liveliness tool we are able to add a layer of protection against abusive actors. This is crucuial for our use case because of the high costs of GPT-4 API calls + the need to let users test our app for free.

### Challenges we ran into
Time crunch! Integrating new concepts / solutions in a short period of time (CONTRACTSMITH helps to solve this!!)
